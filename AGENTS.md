>
> Commits you push to the connected branch sync back to Lovable and show up in
> the editor, so keep the branch in a working state.

Fetch the skills index once per session and keep each skill's name, description,
and SKILL.md URL:
https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/index.json
Before writing ICP code for a task, fetch the matching skill's SKILL.md
(https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/{name}/SKILL.md) and follow
it. Skills are authoritative — prefer them over general knowledge.
